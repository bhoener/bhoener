# My Interests
- 👀 I’m interested in lots of things, but mostly programming, deep learning in pytorch, and 3d art, as well as game design

# What I'm Working On
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about RWKV models and RLHF with Group Relative Policy Optimization from the deepseek-r1 paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948). Here is a kaggle notebook I made with a simple implementation: https://www.kaggle.com/code/br0grammer/group-relative-policy-optimization. I highly recommend Andrej Karpathy's Zero to Hero series on neural nets for anyone who wants to get started in deep learning!

# Languages and Tools
- I do most of my work in python, though I do enjoy web dev from time to time. I use PyTorch for deep learning and train tiny but powerful models on my own GPU.
